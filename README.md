# Conditional-Access-Lab-Location-Based-Access-Control
Practical labs exploring Conditional Access, MFA, and location-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID.
#   Conditional Access Lab 2: Location-Based Access Control

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access can be used to control access based on **network location**. The goal was to understand how trusted locations work, how access can be blocked outside approved networks, and how to safely validate policies using sign-in logs.

This lab was completed in a test tenant and rolled back after validation to avoid user disruption.

## Objectives
- Understand how **Named Locations** are used in Conditional Access
- Configure a **Trusted IP location**
- Create a Conditional Access policy to **block access outside trusted locations**
- Validate enforcement using **Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs**
- Understand the difference between **Report-only** and **Enforced** policies

---

## Environment
- Microsoft Entra ID (test tenant)
- Conditional Access
- Test users
- Browser-based sign-ins

---

## Configuration Summary

### 1. Named Location
- Created a **Trusted Location** using a specific public IP address
- Marked the location as **Trusted**
- Used this location as a condition in Conditional Access policies

---

### 2. Conditional Access Policy
**Policy name:** `CA-Block-Outside-Trusted-Location`

- **Users:** Specific test users
- **Cloud apps:** All cloud apps
- **Condition:** Network location
  - Include: Any network
  - Exclude: Trusted Location
- **Grant control:** Block access
- **Policy state:** Tested in both *On* and *Report-only* modes

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Scenario
- User attempted to sign in from an IP **not included** in the Trusted Location
- Authentication succeeded, but access was **blocked by Conditional Access**

### Validation Method
- Reviewed **Microsoft Entra ID → Sign-in logs**
- Checked the **Conditional Access** tab for the sign-in event
- Confirmed:
  - Policy evaluated
  - Result: **Failure**
  - Grant control: **Block**
  - Reason: Network location condition not met

This confirmed the policy was working as designed.

---

## Key Learnings
- Conditional Access policies are evaluated **together**
- If **any** policy blocks access, the sign-in fails
- UI error messages are not sufficient for troubleshooting
- **Sign-in logs are the source of truth**
- Report-only mode is essential for safe testing
- Rolling back policies is part of normal security operations

---

## Next Steps
- Replace block with **Require MFA** for external locations
- Add country-based conditions
- Implement break-glass account exclusions
- Explore sign-in risk and user risk policies
